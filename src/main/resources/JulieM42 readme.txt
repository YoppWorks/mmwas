Julie M42 soundfont by Les Productions Zvon

This soundfont is specially designed for the AlgoMusic M42 Nebula. All the
samples are looped.  

The progams and the loops of the Julie M42 are not designed to sound natural 
or realistic. They are designed to sound great in the M42. To get the most
natural sound play from G2 to C4 (roughly). Some are similar but none are
exactly alike.

The emphasis in this soundfont is on showcasing the sound manipulation of the
M42, not on real singing emulation. Of course this soundfont can be used in
other soundfont players but the results are not really natural but most are
still very interesting. If you are looking for realistic vocal samples, visit
our website and give a listen to the Julie Vocal collections.

The fxb bank has 32 presets created by Tim Conrardy. The installation note
below was written by Tim too.

______________________________________________________________________

To install:

1. Copy the "julie M42_full.sf2" in the "M42_v2" folder that has the sep files.
2. Copy the "TC_M42_Julie_V2.fxb" bank file in the folder "M42V2Banks".

To use:
1.Instigate M42 nebula in your host.
2.Load the TC_M42V2_2.fxb file into M42.
3.Wait until the SF2 sound set loads.
4.Select a preset and enjoy.

Note: the first 32 presets were made with this SF2 in mind. The rest are from 
the default bank that comes with M42, but still may sound good with this sf2.

If you want to try the new SF2 with the factory or extra banks, load the FXB
bank (such as M42Default.fxb) and the M42 defaults to the factory SF2 set. Then
load the julie M42_full.sf2. The presets will use the samples in the new set.

If you save a song using the new soundset, the new SF2 should load if the song
is recalled.

Once loaded, the samples are accessed with the SFO dialog for Bank and type 
(Fantasy/Analog/Strings/Vintage and Voices).
