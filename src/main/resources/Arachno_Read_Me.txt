INTRODUCTION

Thanks for your interest in Arachno SoundFont!

Arachno SoundFont is a General MIDI-compliant bank of 128 instruments
("presets") and 9 GM/GS drumkits, aimed at enhancing the realism of
your MIDI files and arrangements. It's meant to be used with a
SoundFont 2.x-compatible MIDI synthesizer, either hardware (eg.
Sound Blaster Live!/Audigy/X-Fi) or software (like SynthFont).

First use sfArk (http://www.melodymachine.com) to decompress the provided
.sfArk file to a SoundFont 2.1 file (.sf2) that you can use with your hardware
or software SoundFont sampler. This software is bundled in the original
Arachno SoundFont ZIP archive for your convenience, in a subfolder
named "sfArk".

Please read the bundled HTML documentation, located in the "Documentation"
subfolder of the original ZIP archive, for full information on
this project.

ABOUT ARACHNO SOUNDFONT

This SoundFont project has first started somewhere in mid-2003, as
a modified version of the Magic SoundFont, by Dennis Deutschmann, for
my own MIDI listening purposes.

Acquiring solid SoundFont editing experience over the years, I replaced
many of its original presets with new samples and instruments from various
sources, giving birth to my own custom SoundFont bank, Arachno SoundFont.

After leaving this bank unmodified for over three years (since May 17, 2007)
for many reasons, I finally found the time to write its documentation
and release it for the first time on the internet, as "freeware" work.

IMPORTANT LICENSING INFORMATION

Most portions of this bank actually come from other sources (SoundFont
and GigaSampler libraries, third-party synthesizer samples) that
have been credited in the bundled documentation.

You're free to use Arachno SoundFont in any of your projects. But,
please be aware that this bank is primarily distributed for private,
non-commercial purposes only, as it uses portions from other authors.

If you want to use it for commercial purposes, please obtain a written
consent from the original authors credited in the documentation.

CONTACT INFORMATION

Did you appreciate my work? I'd love to hear from you! If you have made
anything using Arachno SoundFont that you'd like to share (audio tracks,
EAX presets, MIDI files...), I'd very glad to know it!

Countless hours, days, and weeks have been spent on this project, to
search for interesting instruments, sounds and tones, to integrate them
into a global bank, tweak them and test them on a lot of MIDI files.

Arachno SoundFont is being distributed for FREE, for your own personal
listening pleasure and audio production needs. Anyway, if you think
that my work deserves any financial support, you can donate me any amount
of money from my website.

Thanks for your interest in my SoundFont! Hope to hear from you soon.
